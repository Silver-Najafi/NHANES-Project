# NHANES-Project
This project applies three regression approaches — Linear Regression, Binary Logistic Regression, and Generalized Ordinal Logistic Regression — to predict hsCRP levels using the NHANES 2013–2014 dataset.  
The analysis explores different perspectives:  
- Linear Regression for continuous outcomes,  
- Binary Logistic Regression for clinical risk thresholds,  
- Ordinal Regression for categorical risk levels (Low, Medium, High).  

Instead of selecting a single "best" model, the project highlights how each method addresses specific research questions and provides complementary insights for public health studies.
