# NHANES-Project
This project applies three regression approaches to predict hsCRP levels using the NHANES 2013â€“2014 dataset.   The analysis explores different perspectives:   - Linear Regression for continuous outcomes,   - Binary Logistic Regression for clinical risk thresholds,   - Ordinal Regression for categorical risk levels (Low, Medium, High).
