# NHANES-Project
This project applies three regression approaches — "Linear Regression", "Binary Logistic Regression", and "Generalized Ordinal Logistic Regression" — to predict hsCRP levels using the NHANES 2013–2014 dataset by using R.  
The analysis explores different perspectives:  
- Linear Regression for continuous outcomes,  
- Binary Logistic Regression for clinical outcome thresholds,  
- Ordinal Regression for categorical outcome levels (Low, Medium, High).  

Instead of selecting a single "best" model, the project highlights how each method addresses specific research questions and provides complementary insights for public health studies.
